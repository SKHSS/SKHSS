        <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
        <div class="miss">The South Kitsap Homeschool Sports Club began in the backyard of Elena Evert in 1993. Elena’s goal was to provide training in soccer without the pressure so often generated by an organized club. The club started with 10-15 children and each year it became larger. By 1998, it had grown to 100 children and Elena could no longer run it by herself.

A committee was formed soon after Elena moved to Tacoma. It consisted of the following people: Chairman, Marcia Hisel, Secretary Debbie Holmes, Registrar Lucy Craig, Treasurer Jeanne Easley and Field Maintenance Person Val Coots. Debra Pischue and Carla Duffy also assisted. The committee then decided to incorporate the club as a non-profit group known as the Home School Soccer Club. It was founded on much faith and the knowledge that it was greatly needed by home schoolers.</div><br />

        <h3>History</h3>
         The South Kitsap Homeschool Sports Club began in the backyard of Elena Evert in 1993. Elena’s goal was to provide training in soccer without the pressure so often generated by an organized club. The club started with 10-15 children and each year it became larger. By 1998, it had grown to 100 children and Elena could no longer run it by herself.<br /><br />
    A committee was formed soon after Elena moved to Tacoma. It consisted of the following people: Chairman, Marcia Hisel, Secretary Debbie Holmes, Registrar Lucy Craig, Treasurer Jeanne Easley and Field Maintenance Person Val Coots. Debra Pischue and Carla Duffy also assisted. The committee then decided to incorporate the club as a non-profit group known as the Home School Soccer Club. It was founded on much faith and the knowledge that it was greatly needed by home schoolers.<br /><br />
    When the first season began, the club had only one coach for sure, but two or three other possible coaches and many high schoolers who were willing to help us so that they could play. Many, many hours were spent organizing, agonizing, and praying. On opening day, God provided us with volunteers in abundance and the season was off to a good start. Tim Coyle, who had come thinking only of assisting his daughter’s team, ended up filling the most needed position of Head Coach.<br /><br />
    Tim expanded our club when he decided to organize a basketball league that first year. The committee was tired after the soccer season and had no desire to get involved in basketball. However, they offered to support Tim and help where needed. After the basketball season ended, they realized the massive duplication of effort if we remained two clubs. Because of the great need local homeschoolers had for organized sports, they decided to expand and become a sports club. So in the spring of 1999, the club changed its name to South Kitsap Home School Sports Club (SKHSSC) and spent a year re-organizing to provide the three sports it currently offers.<br /><br />
    This club is founded on Christian values, fueled by faith and prayer. As long as we remember this, the club will flourish and provide the training and fun that we are seeking for our children.
